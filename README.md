Hi, I am Khady Sarah Sall, an aerospace engineering student at the Institut of Polytechnic Sciences and Aeronautics (IPSA) in Paris. 
Currently in my final year of a master’s program in Aerospace Vehicles, I specialize in mechanics and structures.

I am passionate about everything related to Mechanics,Structures,CFD, Simulations and Control Alogorithms.

I am currently seeking a final-year internship or a capstone project starting in February 2025, for a duration of six months idealy one hat could lead to a long-term employment (France or abroad).

Attentive to new technological advancements, I always catch the train of innovation and research. This curiosity explains my interest in various fields and motivates me to continue learning and actively contribute to tomorrow’s innovative projects.
